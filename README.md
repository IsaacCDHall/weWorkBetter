I will use this site to find signs of a friendly and exciting workspace atmosphere with a greater focus on collaboration and welbeing than on making money . My primary pain point is websites that take themselves too seriously.

* Billy, the retired guy looking to spice up his life - I intend to use a site to help bring excitement back into my dull life. Since my cat, Gretchen, passed away 4 years ago, i've been in a constant state of anxiety. I hate it when websites make me think of my last cat, but love it when the design is sleek enough for me to be distracted effortlessly.

* Bobby, the friend of a friend- My goal is to find a company that can help develop a website for my business which speciazlizes in cat fur. I will use this site to make sure that my cat fur is conflict free and organic. My primary pain point is websites that I can not relate to.

* As a politician who might want to bring the company in for a government project, I want the website to show that the company can be high-powered, inclusive & safe for everyone at the same time.
* As a potential investor, I want to see that the business has a unique personality that will lift it above having just another boilerplate corporate vibe.
* As a possible CTO, I believe that the business' heavy tech day-to-day business can be balanced out with the involvement and featuring of artists, writers, creatives, & craftspeople from other industries.
